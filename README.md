>New homebrew developed games were very sparse for the Atari 7800 until
the last 2-3 years due in part to efforts by Kenfused and Pacmanplus of Atariage.com
It now seems that more programmers are taking an interest in this wonderfully powerful
videogaming system and tapping into its potential to create games far surpassing
those on the Atari 2600, 5200 and 8bit Atari computers.

>To further help in the learning, and programming of the Atari 7800, the following
original Source Code to many Atari 7800 video games have been provided below.
These games were rescued from Atari ST format diskettes that were thrown out behind
1196 Borregas when Atari closed up in 1996.   The Atari Museum rescued these
important treasures and recovered them from the diskettes.    Many of the compiling
and coding tools as well as the Atari 7800 development tools are Atari ST programs,
which can be run via emulation to be able to natively compile and test code.

I put this code on Github to preserve what I consider to be an interesting
historical artifact. Also this is quite possible the only repo on Github based
on code found on floppy disks in a dumpster.
