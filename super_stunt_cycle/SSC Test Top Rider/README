Dear Atari,

	Here is a test program combined with playfield, showing that the
"Top Rider" device works with the Atari 7800.  This is only a test
and contains bugs where interrupts need tune-up.  The readout is
numeric, without linkage of playfield interaction.

	In the next day or two I will apply decoding of the "Top Rider"
and link it to playfield action.  Is there a phone number I can
upload it to in Chicago, via 1200 baud modem?

    More soon!
