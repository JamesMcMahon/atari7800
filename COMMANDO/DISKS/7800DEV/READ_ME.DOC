Set up the ST computer per its instructions.  
If your 7800 has not been equipped with transfer ROM assembly, 
     you must install it according to the following instructions:
     To open up the 7800, unscrew the bottom.  Lift the shielded 
     PCB from the plastic housing.  Remove RF shield by twisting 
     tabs.  Refer to attached sketch of PCB for position of OS 
     rom.  Remove OS rom in easiest manner.  If you have older 
     7800, simply pull rom from its socket.  If you have newer 
     7800, clip the rom pins and remove solder from PCB holes.  
     Install transfer rom, noting correct pin 1 position on 
     attached sketch.  Put 7800 back together if desired and/or 
     possible.  Note that it will be easier to remember which 
     buttons are Pause, Reset, and Select if plastic housing is 
     in place.
Connect 7800 to power supply, attach 7800 to TV set.  
Attach custom transfer cable to printer port of ST and to the 
     joystick ports of 7800.  You will probably want to make a 
     switchbox for the cable, so that you won't have to 
     constantly remove the cable to plug in a joystick, and vice 
     versa.
If your supercart RAM card has not been equipped with a Write-Enable
     switch, you will need to do that.  See supercart schematic 
     (if you do not have one and need one, call Tom Sloper).  
     Put as much RAM as you will need on the 1-meg ROM emulator.  
     It is set up for (4) 256K bits RAM chips.
Put the RAM card in the cartridge port (chips to the rear).

And off you go!

The 6502 cross-assembler is proprietary.  Your serial number is 
     registered in your name.  Pirating is a no-no!
