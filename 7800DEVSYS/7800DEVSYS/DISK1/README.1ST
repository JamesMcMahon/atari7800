SETTING UP THE DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM:



Set up the ST computer per its instructions.  


Connect standard 7800 to power supply, attach 7800 to TV set.
 
Attach standard parallel transfer cable to printer port of ST and to the 
      25-pin D connector on the development system cartridge.

Put the development system cartridge in the cartridge port
(chips to the rear) and power-up the 7800.

Run DLOAD.TTP on the ST and if properly connected, you will see the
sign-on message from the development system cartridge on your ST
screen (another message is displayed on the TV screen).


And off you go!



SOME INFORMATION THAT WAS NEVER GIVEN IN ANY OF THE OTHER
DOCUMENTATION:




How to use the right and left joystick buttons (7800 games only):
          Initialize SWCHB with the following 4 instructions:

               LDA  #$14
               STA  CTLSWB
               LDA  #0
               STA  SWCHB



                                page 2



          Read the fire buttons from:

               INPT0   -  player 0, right button (d7=1 if pushed)
               INPT1   -  player 0, left button  (d7=1 if pushed)
               INPT2   -  player 1, right button (d7=1 if pushed)
               INPT3   -  player 1, left button  (d7=1 if pushed)

How to program for the 2600 on the 7800 Development System:
     1.   A 2600 "lock-in" must be performed before anything else
          and is accomplished by these 2 instructions:
          
               LDA  #$FD
               STA  $08

     2.   Six 4k blocks of memory space ("banks" on the cartridge) are
          available for use by 2600 game developers.  They are:
                    5000-5FFF
                    7000-7FFF
                    9000-9FFF
                    B000-BFFF
                    D000-DFFF
                    F000-FFFF


Since 2600 cartridges have 1,2,4, or 8 banks of 4k each, only
cartridges of up to 4 banks in size may be developed with this system.
8 bank cartridges will need the dedicated 2600 development system when
it comes out.  It is recommended that the F000-FFFF bank not be used
during game development (except to store hardware vectors and to
execute the 2600 lock-in described above) since 122 bytes at FF80-FFF9
are dedicated to 7800 encription signatures & the development system
requires this area for system code.  F000-FF7F may be used, but it
cannot be "packed" full of code as would be possible in the EPROM
cartridge.  Also, keep in mind that the development system does not
emulate bank switching or SARA ram accesses precisely.  Since the 7800
development system was not expressly designed to run in 2600 mode,
some problems have been observed when it is used in 2600 mode.  Most
development system boards are tested to see how they perform in 2600
mode.  Some work fine but others only allow load & go with no debugger
communications once 2600 mode has been locked-in.  If the debugger
fails to work once the 2600 program has been started (either no
communications or ?? responses to legitimate debugger commands), you
may have a board or base-unit (or combination thereof) which cannot
tolerate 2600 mode.  Try a different base-unit or different
development system cart.

Bank switching is used for 2600 cartridges larger than 4K.  When it
was first designed (in the stone age of 1977), the 2600 base-unit
brought only enough address lines out to the cartridge to address
4k.  Now that ROM has become so cheap, 2600 Bank switching necessary
to address larger carts.  This is accomplished by reading a "magic"
location.  Normally, a LDA ABSOLUTE is executed followed by a JMP
ABSOLUTE.  A copy of these two instructions is found at the same
offset in both the bank being switched to and the bank being switched
from.  In addition, at power-up, the programmer cannot assume which
bank will get control first.  All banks must vector RESET thru proper
bank switching code to the bank with the start-up code.  The magic
addresses to be read for bank switching purposes (when applicable)
are:

cart size:     1 bank    2 bank    4 bank    8 bank

                none     $FFF8     $FFF6     $FFF2     lowest bank #
                         $FFF9     $FFF7     $FFF3          |
                                   $FFF8     $FFF4          |
                                   $FFF9     $FFF5          V
                                             $FFF6     highest bank #

                                             $FFF8
                                             $FFF9

Some previously released 7800 cartridges used additional RAM provided on
the cartridge itself.  This has become prohibitively expensive and is
not allowed for future game development.  Exceptions will be made only
if cleared in writing by Atari management first.



When sending EPROMS to Atari, the following information should be
     provided (on a 1/2" x 3/4" label that does not cover up the
     printing on the EPROM):

     GAME   NAME   (including  system - may be abbreviated)
     DATE
     CHECKSUM
     BANK #

     For example:             7800 BALLBL.   2600 SOCC

                              BANK67         

The preferred form of game milestone submission to Atari is sending
the source code on floppy disk together with the .O files generated by
that source.  A .BAT file containing the command line for DLOAD.TTP
would be a convenience as well.  Source code is manditory for final
submissions before game release.
