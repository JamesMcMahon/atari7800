To convert a 32K 7800 EPROM board to a 48K EPROM board:

Remove the socket for U2.

On component sid of board:
   Cut trace between pins 28 and 27 of U2
   Cut trace between U3 pin 13 and U2 pin 20.
   Cut trace between U3 pin 12 and U1 pin 20.  Note that this trace runs
      from U3 on the component side and then connects through the board to
      the trace to U1.  Cut the component side trace and suck the solder
      out of the connect-thru hole.  This hole can then be used later.

Mount a 7404 as follows:
   The 7404 will be soldered in place on top of the 74138.  The following
   pins will be connected:
	74138	7404
         2       1
         8       7
        16      14--This requires a bent pin, see below.

   Bend pins 2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13 straight out from the IC.
   Cut all of the above except pin 2 as they will not be used.
   Bend the leg portion of pin 2 straight up--this will aid in connecting
      a wire to it later.
   Bend the remaining pins (1,7,14) so that the are straight down.
   Looking at pin 14 from the side, bend it to the right until it will make
      contact with pin 16 of the 74138 when placed on top.

   Place the 7404 on top of the 74138 and solder in place.

Replace the socket for U2.

On the solder side:
   Using thin insulated wire (wire wrap type is perfect) connect:

   U3 pin 14 to the connect-thru hole that connects to U1 pin 20.
   U3 pin 1 to U2 pin 27
   U2 pin 20 to U4 (7404) pin 2 (on component side.)
