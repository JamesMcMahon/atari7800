The 7800 interface communicates with the ST via the parallel printer port.
The low four bits are used as a data path.  The high four bits are used as
control lines for the interface.

As seen from the ST, the lines are as follows:

Write meaning:

	Bit(s)		Meaning
	0-3		Data to 7800
	4		Force addresses to range X000 - Xfff where X is set by
			the dip switches.  For the 7800 development, these
			should be 0, thereby forcing addresses to access
			0000-0fff.  Active when 1.
	5		Reset--Active when 0.  Drop this to 0 momentarily
			to reset the 7800.
	6		IRQ--Active when 0.  Drop this momentarily to request
			an IRQ interrupt.
	7		Data Direction.	0 = 7800 -> ST
					1 = ST -> 7800

Read meaning:

	Bit(s)		Meaning
	0-3		Data from 7800
	4-7		Not valid.

From the 7800, the parallel interface is accessed at any address in the range
X700 - X7ff.  X set by dip switches.  The bit meanings are as follows:

Write meaning:

	Bit(s)		Meaning
	0-3		Data to ST
	4		Left switch to ST joystick port--Signals that a BRK
			has been encountered
	5		Down switch to ST joystick port--Signals that the 7800
			is in the Monitor
	6		Up   switch to ST joystick port--Not defined
	7		Centronics BUSY signal

Read meaning:

	Bit(s)		Meaning
	0-3		Data from ST
	4		Force bit (see ST write bit 4)
	5		unused--Zero.
	6		Data Direction bit (see ST write bit 7)
	7		Centronics strobe (Active Low)


To send to the 7800:
1.	ST waits until BUSY is low.
2.	ST loads data into parallel port.  Lower 4 bits are data, upper four
	   bits are 1110 (Data direction, IRQ, Reset all set; Force clear).
3.	ST lowers Centronics strobe.
4.	7800 reads data.
5.	7800 raises BUSY
6.	ST raises strobe.
7.	7800 lowers BUSY when ready to receive new nybble.

When reading from the 7800:
1.	7800 waits for Data Direction to be 0 and strobe to be 1.
2.	ST loads 0110xxxx into parallel port (IRQ, Reset set; Direction and
	   Force clear).
3.	ST lowers and raises Strobe.
4.	ST waits for BUSY to go high.
5.	7800 loads 1UDLxxxx into parallel port (BUSY high, UDL joystick lines,
	   xxxx data to ST)
6.	ST reads data from parallel port.
7.	ST drops Strobe low.
8.	7800 drops BUSY low.
9.	ST raises Strobe.  Until all data read, loop back to step 1.
10.	ST loads 1110xxxx into paralle port
11.	ST lowers and raises Strobe.

The following commands are available (in various stages of testing) in the
interface monitor rom:

All byte and word values are transmitted high nybble first.

    Value of
     Nybble	Command
	0	Null--Do Nothing

	1	Load next 4 nybbles as address:
		This address will be used for other commands
		N1-N4	: Address

	2	Store two nybbles at address (from command 1) and increment
		address.
		N1-N2	: byte to store

	3	Read Byte at address & increment address.

	4	Load breakpoint information and arm breakpoint:
		N1	: Breakpoint number (0-13)
		N2-N5	: Breakpoint address
		N6-N9	: Number of times to hit breakpoint before breaking

	5	Disarm breakpoint:
		N1	: Breakpoint to disarm

	6	Report registers in the following order:
		N1-N4	: Program Counter
		N5-N6	: Accumulator
		N7-N8	: X-index
		N9-N10	: Y-index
		N11-N12	: Processor status
		N13-N14 : Stack Pointer

	7	Set Register
		N1	: Register to set:
			0 = PCH
			1 = PCL
			2 = Accumulator
			3 = X-index
			4 = Y-index
			5 = Processor Status
			6 = Stack Pointer
		N2-N3	: value

	8	Compute and report CRC for address range (reports 16 bit CRC)
		N1-N4	: Start Address
		N5-N8	: Stop Address

	9	Single Step at PC

	10	Run at PC

Commands that would be useful for speeding transfers would be block move
commands.

To reset the 7800:
1.	Load 1101xxxx to parallel port
2.	Strobe
3.	Load 1111xxxx to parallel port
4.	Strobe
5.	Load 1110xxxx to parallel port
6.	Strobe
7.	Wait for Monitor status to appear

To interrupt the 7800:
1.	Load 1010xxxx to parallel port
2.	Strobe
3.	Load 1110xxxx to parallel port
4.	Strobe
5.	Wait for Monitor status to appear
