                                 (25-July-88)

             DLOAD.TTP now displays its version number when it starts:
        this one is version 0.5.  All console i/o may now be captured to a
        disk file so that a debug session may be preserved for later
        scrutiny.  To begin capture, type cntrl-F before any other
        characters have been entered on a command line.  You will be
        prompted to enter a filename where the captured data will be
        sent.  To close out the capture, type cntrl-F again.  This
        feature is useful for preserving for analysis display lists in
        RAM, multiple tracings, or even the results of 6502 programs used
        to generate graphics etc.

             NEO2S.TTP now accepts another input file from which user
        defined labels are to be used.  The previous version of
        NEO2S.TTP always created generic symbols "LABEL00:", "LABEL01:",
        etc. where graphics partitions should be.  This new version
        accepts a (presumably source) file whose labels are to be used
        instead.  The first label found (in MADMAC assembler syntax) in
        this input file will be the first used, the second second and so
        forth.  In this way, graphics may be created, user-defined label
        names may be substituted for the generic ones, and the graphics
        may be updated at the .NEO level without requiring user-defined
        labels to be retyped at each update.
